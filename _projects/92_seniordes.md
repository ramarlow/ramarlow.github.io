The main project for Wisconsin Robotics—UW-Madison's competitive robotics team—is a scaled-down Mars rover that competes in the University Rover Challenge. Just like the real rovers, ours is required to extract and test subsurface regolith (loose rock and dust) samples and analyze them for signs of life. For our capstone design project, some robotics teammates and I have undertaken the task of designing a soil drill and fluorometer to accomplish this task. I've been primarily responsible for the mechanical design and testing of the drill, which includes the rotary auger to move soil and the insertion mechanism to drive the drill into the ground.

I'll hopefully continue to update this page as the project progresses, but here are some images of our design so far.
