The main project for Wisconsin Robotics—UW-Madison's competitive robotics team—is a scaled-down Mars rover that competes in the University Rover Challenge. Just like the real rovers, ours is required to extract and test subsurface regolith (loose soil) samples and analyze them for signs of life. For our capstone design project, some robotics teammates and I have undertaken the task of designing a soil drill and fluorometer to accomplish this task.
