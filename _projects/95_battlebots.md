As part of Wisconsin Robotics, in an attempt to appease all the kids who want to break our robots (including some team members), our most recent project is a set of nonlethal battlebots that engage in “sparring” by whacking each other with plastic squeaky hammers. As subteam lead, I’ve tried to delegate much of the work, especially on the mechanical and software sides, to new members so they can develop skills. My most direct involvement has been guiding members through the process of designing a PCB to carry our ESP32 microcontrollers, connecting them to power supply circuitry and motor drivers. This should solve a lot of wire management and shorting issues once we solder and install the boards.
