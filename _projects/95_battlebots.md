As part of Wisconsin Robotics, in an attempt to appease all the kids who want to break our robots (including some team members), our most recent project is a set of nonlethal battlebots that engage in “sparring” by whacking each other with plastic squeaky hammers. I designed the drive train parts for the first iteration of the chassis, which was modeled on the dimensions of one of our old projects, but facricated using laser cut HDF instead of the original 3D printing. The robots would hit each other on the acrylic lids, which were mounted on limit switches to detect successful hits. 

As subteam lead since then, I’ve tried to delegate much of the work, especially on the mechanical and software sides, to new members so they can develop skills. My most direct involvement has been guiding members through the process of designing a PCB to carry our ESP32 microcontrollers, connecting them to power supply circuitry and motor drivers. This should solve a lot of wire management and shorting issues once we solder and install the boards.
