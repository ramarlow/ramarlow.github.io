excerpt: "[Triton](https://tritonrobotics.com/), a division of Neptune Medical, is working to make a robotically-controlled endoscope using Neptune's really cool [rigidizing technology](https://gipathfinder.com/technology/). I was lucky enough to work there over the summer of 2023, where I helped design and implement tests and equipment for use with flexible composite medical catheters."

While working at Triton, my biggest project was updating the test fixturing and methods used to measure and compare the stiffness of endoscopes. The main design goals were to avoid damaging the test samples, incorporate a water bath for submerged testing, and streamline data gathering and processing to enable faster design iteration. The new fixture has differently shaped jaws to reduce pinching damage, linear rails for repeatable positioning, and a tub to allow wet and dry testing. I designed the fixture in Solidworks, assembled it, then conducted trials and processed data in Python to verify its performance and reliability.

Another project I undertook at Triton was prototyping a handheld pressurized air supply for product demonstration purposes. The previous solution had relied on a 5-gallon air tank, which was impractical for off-site demonstrations and generally inconvenient for portability. After trying to solve this by sourcing a smaller tank, I further reduced the size and complexity by switching to compressed CO2 canisters, which are already commonly available for bike tire inflation, and designed a palm-sized enclosure for a small regulator and valve. In testing, I determined that the new device would supply enough air for at least 20 rigidization cycles, about 4 times what is usually used in demonstration.
