excerpt: "[Silicon Valley Bicycle Exchange](https://bikex.org) is a nonprofit that fixes broken bikes and donates them to people in need of transport, while also building bike repair skills in community members. I volunteered part-time there over the summer of 2022 and try to stop by whenever I'm around."
