excerpt: "I had a really fun time returning as an intern to [Triton](https://tritonrobotics.com/) in the summer of 2024. I rejoined the endoscopy team to improve and expand testing capabilities, support manufacturing and documentation efforts, and also wrote a tool for analyzing roslogs of robot telemetry."
