Thanks to my previous experience at Triton, I was able to jump straight into many of my projects during this second internship, but the level of growth and design innovation that had taken place over a year was still consistently impressive. My first task was conducting device fatigue failure testing to evaluate different polymer layers for the endoscope body. This consisted not only of executing automated motor driving test scripts and recording results, but also of doubling our testing capacity by building a second set of test fixtures so units could be run on multiple capital robots simultaneously. After the initial couple weeks of design sprint yielded a successful design,
