[Silicon Valley Bicycle Exchange](https://bikex.org) is a nonprofit that fixes broken or abandoned bikes and donates them to people in need of transport. I volunteered part-time there over the summer of 2022, during which I worked three days a week to diagnose and repair bikes, helping the organization reach its goal of 1000 bikes donated that year. I also helped mentor other volunteers in tasks that I had more experience with. This was a great opportunity to work hands-on with mechanical components like bearings, chain-sprocket drives, and cable actuated systems. 

Even though my involvement has since decreased a fair bit, I typically still try to stop by and get some work done whenever I'm able to.
