excerpt: "[Triton](https://tritonrobotics.com/){:target="_blank"}, a division of Neptune Medical, is working to make a robotically-controlled endoscope using Neptune's really cool [rigidizing technology](https://gipathfinder.com/technology/){:target="_blank"}. I was lucky enough to work there over the summer of 2023, where I helped design and implement tests and equipment for use with flexible composite medical catheters."
